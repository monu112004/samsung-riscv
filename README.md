1. Open the bash terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your file.
2. Use the following command to create and edit a new .c file:
   ```sh
   gedit sum_1ton.c

2. Verify the .c file contents using the cat command:
``` sh
cat sum_1ton.c
```
3. Compile the C program for RISC-V architecture using:
``` sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum_1ton.o sum_1ton.c
```
4. Disassemble the object file to view its assembly code using:
``` sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum_1ton.o
```
5. Use /main in the terminal to locate the main function in the assembly output.

#  RISC-V ISA Simulation with SPIKE
This repository provides instructions for setting up and using SPIKE, a RISC-V ISA simulator, along with the Proxy Kernel (pk) for program execution. Follow the steps below to install the necessary tools, run simulations, and debug RISC-V programs effectively.

##  What is SPIKE?
SPIKE is an open-source RISC-V ISA simulator written in C++. It emulates a RISC-V core and cache system, enabling developers to test RISC-V programs without hardware. SPIKE supports running standalone programs as well as operating systems like Linux

## Testing the SPIKE Simulator
To validate the setup, compile and execute a sample program (sum_1ton.c) using both the GCC and RISC-V compilers.
### Using GCC Compiler:
``` sh
gcc product.c  
./a.out
```

### Using RISC-V Compiler:
``` sh
spike pk product.o
```
## Analyzing the Assembly Code
### Objdump Analysis:
Generate the assembly code with the following command:
``` sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum_1ton.o | less
```
![VirtualBox_vsdworkshop_13_01_2025_20_43_47](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04a7db80-2d33-42ed-bafd-77a29c09d413)

### Debugging with SPIKE:
1. Open the debugger using the command:
``` sh
spike -d pk product.o
```
2. Perform debugging operations in the terminal.
   
## Optimization Levels
Snapshots of RISC-V objdump at different optimization levels (-O1 and -Ofast) provide insights into how compiler optimizations affect the generated assembly code. Use these options during compilation to analyze the differences:

-O1 Optimization

-Ofast Optimization

# Understanding RISC-V and Its Instruction Formats

## What is RISC-V?
RISC-V is an open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) that enables developers to design processors tailored to specific applications. Based on Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) principles, RISC-V represents the fifth generation of processors built on this concept. Its open and free nature means developers can utilize RISC-V without purchasing licenses, making it a compelling alternative to proprietary processor technologies.

## Instruction Formats in RISC-V
The instruction format of a processor defines how machine language instructions are structured for execution. These instructions are composed of binary data (0s and 1s), each segment providing details about data location and operations to be performed. In RISC-V, there are six primary instruction formats:

1. **R-format**
2. **I-format**
3. **S-format**
4. **B-format**
5. **U-format**
6. **J-format**
<img width="772" alt="instructions_types" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6c2154d-57bb-44cc-a4a2-b5cd4480c46f" />

Letâ€™s examine each format in detail.

### 1. R-type Instruction
R-type (Register-type) instructions operate on registers rather than memory locations. These are used for arithmetic and logical operations. Each instruction is 32 bits and divided into six fields:

#### Structure:

| Field Name | Size  | Description                            |
|------------|-------|----------------------------------------|
| Opcode     | 7 bits| Determines the instruction type        |
| rd         | 5 bits| Destination register                  |
| func3      | 3 bits| Specifies the type of operation       |
| rs1        | 5 bits| First source register                 |
| rs2        | 5 bits| Second source register                |
| func7      | 7 bits| Additional operation specification    |

#### Example: ADD r9, r2, r5
- **Operation:** Adds values in registers r2 and r5, storing the result in r9.
- **Field Breakdown:**

  - Opcode: `0110011`
  - rd (Destination): `r9` -> `01001`
  - rs1 (Source 1): `r2` -> `00010`
  - rs2 (Source 2): `r5` -> `00101`
  - func3: `000`
  - func7: `0000000`
- **32-bit Instruction:** `0000000_00101_00010_000_01001_0110011`

- **Field Breakdown:**

  - Opcode: `0110011`
  - rd (Destination): `r10` -> `01010`

  - func7: `0000000`
- **32-bit Instruction:** `0000000_00100_00001_100_01010_0110011`


#### Example: SLT r11, r2, r4
- **Operation:** Sets r11 to 1 if r2 < r4; otherwise, sets r11 to 0.
- **Field Breakdown:**

  - Opcode: `0110011`
  - rd (Destination): `r11` -> `01011`
  - rs1 (Source 1): `r2` -> `00010`
  - rs2 (Source 2): `r4` -> `00100`
  - func3: `010`

#### Example: ADDI r12, r4, 5
- **Operation:** Adds immediate value 5 to the value in r4 and stores it in r12.
- **Field Breakdown:**
  - Opcode: `0010011`
  - rd (Destination): `r12` -> `01100`
  - rs1 (Source): `r4` -> `00100`
  - imm[11:0] (Immediate): `000000000101`
  - func3: `000`
- **32-bit Instruction:** `000000000101_00100_000_01100_0010011`
